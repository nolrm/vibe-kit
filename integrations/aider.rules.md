# ContextKit Rules for Aider

## Project Standards
- Follow: @.contextkit/standards/code-style.md
- Testing: @.contextkit/standards/testing.md
- Guidelines: @.contextkit/standards/ai-guidelines.md
- Architecture: @.contextkit/standards/architecture.md

## Component Patterns
- Use: @.contextkit/templates/component.tsx
- Tests: @.contextkit/templates/test.tsx

## Type Safety
- Use: @.contextkit/types/strict.tsconfig.json
- Global types: @.contextkit/types/global.d.ts

## Always Include
When creating new code, always:
1. Follow TypeScript strict mode
2. Include proper error handling
3. Add comprehensive tests with numbered cases (1., 2., 3.)
4. Follow project naming conventions
5. Include proper TypeScript types
6. Add meaningful comments
7. Ensure accessibility (a11y) compliance
