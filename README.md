# ContextKit

> Context Engineering for AI Development

Give your AI assistants (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Continue, Windsurf) structured context through markdown files. ContextKit creates a knowledge base that ensures AI generates code matching your exact patterns, style, and architecture—no more hallucinated code or mismatched conventions.

ContextKit is a CLI tool that provides **context-engineering** capabilities by creating `.contextkit/` directories with project standards, guidelines, and patterns that AI assistants read automatically.

**[Read the full documentation](https://contextkit-docs.vercel.app/)**

## Why ContextKit?

**The problem:** LLMs are great at syntax, not at *your* conventions. Generic AI output requires manual fixes for style, structure, and architecture.

**The solution:** ContextKit provides your AI with:
- **Glossary** of project terminology and business terms (e.g., `checkout`, `customer`, `order`)
- **Standards** for code style, testing patterns, and architecture
- **Templates** with canonical component shapes

Update `.md` files as your project evolves; the AI follows.

## Multi-Platform Support

Works with: **Cursor** • **Claude Code** • **GitHub Copilot** • **Codex CLI** • **Gemini CLI** • **Aider** • **Continue** • **Windsurf**

Each platform gets auto-loaded bridge files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`, etc.) so your AI tools read project standards automatically.

---

## Quick Start (60s)

**Requirements:** Node.js 14.x+ (16.x+ recommended) and npm/yarn. Optional: Git for hooks, AI tools for usage.

```bash
# Step 1: Install globally (recommended)
npm i -g @nolrm/contextkit

# Step 2: Navigate to your project and install
cd your-project
contextkit install
```

This creates `.contextkit/` with skeleton context files (blank templates to be filled by AI):

```
.contextkit/
  standards/       # Skeleton files: code-style.md, testing.md, architecture.md, ai-guidelines.md, workflows.md
                  # Real files: glossary.md (universal), README.md (overview)
  commands/        # analyze.md (project analysis & customization)
  templates/       # skeleton template files (component, test, story, hook, api)
```

**Generate content with AI** (recommended):

```bash
ck analyze
# AI scans your codebase and generates content for the skeleton files
# or in Cursor chat:  @.contextkit/commands/analyze.md
```

⚠️ **Important:** After running `ck analyze`, manually review and edit the generated content to match your exact needs. The AI provides a starting point, but you must customize it.

## Multi-Team Workflow

Perfect for teams where members use different AI tools:

```bash
# First team member (any tool) - sets up the project
contextkit install

# Each team member adds their platform
ck claude      # creates CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/
ck cursor      # creates .cursor/rules/ (scoped .mdc files)
ck copilot     # creates .github/copilot-instructions.md
ck codex       # creates AGENTS.md
ck gemini      # creates GEMINI.md + .gemini/settings.json
ck aider       # creates CONVENTIONS.md + .aider/rules.md
ck continue    # creates .continue/rules/ + config.yaml
ck windsurf    # creates .windsurfrules + .windsurf/rules/
ck vscode      # alias for copilot
```

Each platform generates bridge files that the AI tool auto-reads. If a bridge file already exists (e.g., you have a custom `CLAUDE.md`), ContextKit appends its section below your content instead of overwriting. Share your `.contextkit/standards/*.md` files with the team and everyone gets the same context.

## See the difference (before → after)

**Prompt**
```
"Add checkout flow for customer"
```

**What the AI does with ContextKit**
- Reads `glossary.md` → `checkout` = checkout process; `customer` = customer account
- Applies `code-style.md` → strict TS, functional components
- Follows `testing.md` → numbered test cases

**Result (diff)**
```diff
- const Checkout = () => <button>Buy</button>
+ export function CheckoutFlow({ customer }: { customer: string }) {
+   // Uses customer from glossary context
+   return <div>Checkout for {customer}</div>
+ }
```

---

## Use it in your tool

**Cursor** — rules auto-load from `.cursor/rules/`, slash commands in `.cursor/prompts/`
```
/analyze    # scan codebase and generate standards
/review     # code review with checklist
/fix        # diagnose and fix bugs
```

**Claude Code** — reads `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/`, slash commands in `.claude/commands/`
```bash
/analyze    # scan codebase and generate standards
/review     # code review with checklist
claude "create checkout flow for customer"
```

**GitHub Copilot** — reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` automatically
```
@.contextkit Create checkout flow for customer
```

**Codex CLI** — reads `AGENTS.md` automatically
```bash
codex "create checkout flow for customer"
```

**CLI** (Chat with AI)
```bash
ck ai "create a button"
```

## Slash Commands

ContextKit installs reusable slash commands for supported platforms:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/analyze` | Scan codebase and generate standards content |
| `/review` | Code review with checklist |
| `/fix` | Diagnose and fix bugs |
| `/refactor` | Refactor code with safety checks |
| `/test` | Generate comprehensive tests |
| `/doc` | Add documentation |
| `/squad` | Kick off a squad task — write the PO spec |
| `/squad-architect` | Design the technical plan from the PO spec |
| `/squad-dev` | Implement code following the architect plan |
| `/squad-test` | Write and run tests against acceptance criteria |
| `/squad-review` | Review the full pipeline and give a verdict |
| `/squad-batch` | Kick off multiple tasks at once (batch PO specs) |
| `/squad-run` | Auto-run the remaining pipeline for batch tasks |

**Claude Code** — available as `/analyze`, `/review`, etc. in `.claude/commands/`
**Cursor** — available as slash commands in Chat via `.cursor/prompts/`

Both platforms delegate to the universal command files in `.contextkit/commands/`, so you maintain one set of workflows.

## Squad Workflow

The squad workflow turns a single AI session into a structured multi-role pipeline. Each role has its own slash command that reads and writes to a shared handoff file (`.contextkit/squad/handoff.md`), simulating a team of specialists.

### Pipeline Roles

| Step | Role | Command | What it does |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Product Owner | `/squad` | Writes a user story, acceptance criteria, edge cases, and scope |
| 2 | Architect | `/squad-architect` | Designs the technical approach, files to change, and implementation steps |
| 3 | Developer | `/squad-dev` | Implements the code following the architect's plan |
| 4 | Tester | `/squad-test` | Writes and runs tests against the PO's acceptance criteria |
| 5 | Reviewer | `/squad-review` | Reviews everything and gives a PASS or NEEDS-WORK verdict |

### Single-Task Flow

```bash
/squad "add dark mode support"        # PO writes the spec
/squad-architect                       # Architect designs the plan
/squad-dev                             # Dev implements the code
/squad-test                            # Tester writes and runs tests
/squad-review                          # Reviewer gives the verdict
```

### Batch Flow

For multiple tasks, use batch mode to spec them all up front, then run the full pipeline automatically:

```bash
/squad-batch "add dark mode" "fix login bug" "refactor checkout"
# PO writes specs for all three tasks

/squad-run
# Runs Architect → Dev → Test → Review for each task sequentially
```

### Feedback Loop

Any downstream role can raise questions for an upstream role. When this happens, the pipeline pauses and directs you to the right command:

```
Reviewer has questions for Dev → run /squad-dev to clarify
Tester has questions for Architect → run /squad-architect to clarify
Architect has questions for PO → run /squad to clarify
```

After clarifications are added, re-run the asking role's command to continue. This prevents misunderstandings from compounding through the pipeline.

## Git Hooks & Quality Gates

ContextKit can optionally install Git hooks during `ck install`. Uses `git config core.hooksPath` to point Git at `.contextkit/hooks/` — no external dependencies like Husky required. Works in any git repo, not just Node.js projects.

For **Node.js projects**, a `prepare` script is automatically added to `package.json` so hooks activate for all developers after `npm install` — no need for everyone to run `ck install`.

| Hook | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **pre-push** | **Quality Gates** — auto-detects your project framework and runs the appropriate checks |
| **commit-msg** | Enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format |

### Framework-Aware Quality Gates

The pre-push hook detects your project type and runs the right quality checks automatically. All gates skip gracefully when tools aren't installed.

| Framework | Checks |
|-----------|--------|
| **Node.js** | TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, build, test (auto-detects npm/yarn/pnpm/bun) |
| **Python** | ruff/flake8, mypy, black/ruff format, pytest |
| **Rust** | cargo check, clippy, cargo test |
| **Go** | go vet, golangci-lint, go test |
| **PHP** | PHPStan, PHPUnit |
| **Ruby** | RuboCop, RSpec/rake test |
| **Java** | Maven verify / Gradle check |

### Commit Message Format

When the `commit-msg` hook is enabled, all commits must follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login page"
git commit -m "fix: resolve null pointer in checkout"
git commit -m "docs: update API reference"
git commit -m "test(cart): add edge case coverage"
```

Hooks are optional and can be skipped with `ck install --no-hooks`.
