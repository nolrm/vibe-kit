## Manual Git Hooks Installation

If you skipped Git hooks during installation, you can install them later:

```bash
# Run the setup script
./vibe-kit/hooks/setup-hooks.sh
```

## Configuration

The installation creates a `.vibe-kit/config.yml` file that tracks whether Git hooks are enabled:

```yaml
# Vibe Kit Configuration
version: "1.0.0"
project_name: "my-project"
project_type: "react-vite"

# Features
features:
  testing: true
  documentation: true
  code_review: true
  linting: true
  type_safety: true
  git_hooks: true  # or false if skipped
```
